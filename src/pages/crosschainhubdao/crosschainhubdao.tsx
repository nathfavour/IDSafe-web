              The carbon credit market is essential for addressing climate change, but current systems face challenges such as inefficiency, lack of transparency, and difficulty in verifying carbon credits across different blockchain networks. This project aims to create a cross-chain marketplace that allows users to buy and sell tokenized carbon credits seamlessly, leveraging Chainlink’s services for interoperability and real-time data.

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              The goal is to develop a blockchain-based carbon credit marketplace that integrates with multiple blockchains, provides real-time pricing, and ensures the authenticity of carbon credits using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Price Feeds.
